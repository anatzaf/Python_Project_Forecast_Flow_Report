# Python_Project_Forecast_Flow_Report

This project was created as part of the data engineering course, with the aim of optimizing processes at my workplace.

The report knows how to take a data set of loans, and generate a future flow for them.

As part of the logic in the report, it is possible to play with the early repayment rate so that the loan portfolio is repaid faster or slower - depending on what we want to examine.
